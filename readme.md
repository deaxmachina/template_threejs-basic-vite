# Basic Three.js Vite Starter Template

*Credit*: [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) by Bruno Simon modified starter code for Lesson 10 Debug UI
Note that this is for the basic tempalte which doesn't use shaders. I haven't been able to get shader .glsl files to load using the vanilla Vite tempalte. 

## Setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
